## Consequences
Jest provides a comprehensive testing solution that works seamlessly with JavaScript environments. It comes with built-in assertions, mock functions, and offers snapshot testing.

## Other Solutions Considered

### Mocha + Chai
**Pros**:
- Mocha provides a flexible test structure.
- Chai offers a wide range of assertions.

**Cons**:
- Requires integrating multiple libraries.
- Less integrated than Jest.

### Jasmine
**Pros**:
- Behavior-driven development (BDD) framework.
- Has built-in assertions.

**Cons**:
- Fewer utilities out of the box compared to Jest.
