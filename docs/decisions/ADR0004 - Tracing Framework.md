# ADR 0004: Tracing Framework

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Distributed tracing is critical for understanding the flow of requests and diagnosing performance issues in a complex, microservices-based architecture. Selecting an appropriate tracing framework is essential for capturing and analyzing trace data effectively.

## Decision
Use OpenTelemetry as our primary tracing framework.

## Consequences
OpenTelemetry provides a comprehensive and standardized solution for distributed tracing. It supports various backends, including Jaeger and Zipkin, and integrates well with other observability tools. This framework ensures that we can capture and analyze trace data consistently across different services.

## Other Solutions Considered

### Jaeger
**Pros**:
- Comprehensive open-source tracing solution.
- Provides end-to-end tracing capabilities.

**Cons**:
- Requires additional setup and integration compared to OpenTelemetry.

### Zipkin
**Pros**:
- Easy to set up and integrate.
- Provides essential tracing capabilities.

**Cons**:
- Less feature-rich and flexible compared to OpenTelemetry.
- Limited support for newer standards and protocols.
