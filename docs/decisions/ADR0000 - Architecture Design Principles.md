# ADR000: Architecture Design Principles

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Architecture Design Principles guide the decision-making process, ensuring consistency and alignment with the overarching objectives of the project.

## Principles

1. **Security and Privacy**: Prioritize the protection of user data and ensure secure access and operations in all components of the system.
   
2. **Modularity and Decomposition**: Design components in a way that promotes separation of concerns, enabling better scalability and maintainability.

3. **Data Integrity and Quality**: Ensure the accuracy, reliability, and consistency of data throughout its entire lifecycle.

4. **Data-Centricity and Relational Mapping**: Design with a focus on the data and its relationships, leveraging tools and technologies that best support this focus.

5. **Scalability and Performance**: Build the system to handle growth, both in terms of data volume and user load, without degrading performance.

6. **Flexibility and Adaptability**: The architecture should be flexible enough to accommodate changes in requirements or technology.

7. **Interoperability and Compatibility**: Ensure components and systems work seamlessly together, promoting integrations and avoiding vendor lock-in.

8. **Continuous Improvement and Evolution**: Embrace practices that allow for iterative improvement and adaptation to emerging technologies or methodologies.

9. **Portability and Cloud Agnosticism**: Design with the ability to run on different cloud providers or even on-premises, avoiding vendor-specific dependencies.

10. **Transparency and Documentation**: Keep processes and decisions transparent, and maintain comprehensive documentation for clarity and future reference.

11. **Financial Sustainability and Competitiveness**: Make decisions that balance immediate needs with long-term financial sustainability, ensuring competitiveness in the market.
