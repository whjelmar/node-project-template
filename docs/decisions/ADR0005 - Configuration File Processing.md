## Consequences
Cosmiconfig provides a flexible and powerful solution for loading configuration files in various formats (JSON, YAML, JS, etc.). It supports hierarchical configuration and environment variable overrides, making it easy to manage configuration settings across different environments.

## Other Solutions Considered

### Config
**Pros**:
- Simple and straightforward configuration management.
- Supports hierarchical configuration.

**Cons**:

- Lacks some advanced features of Cosmiconfig.

### Dotenv
**Pros**:
- Easy to use and integrate.
- Focuses on environment variable management.

**Cons**:
- Limited to environment variables.
- Does not support hierarchical configuration or multiple file formats.
