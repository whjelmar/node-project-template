## Consequences
Electron allows us to build cross-platform desktop applications using web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides a robust set of APIs to interact with the native operating system, making it an ideal choice for building modern desktop applications.

## Other Solutions Considered

### NW.js
**Pros**:
- Similar capabilities to Electron.
- Supports more native features.

**Cons**:
- Less popular and smaller community compared to Electron.
- Documentation and support are not as extensive.

### Qt
**Pros**:
- Powerful and mature framework for building native applications.
- Supports multiple programming languages.

**Cons**:
- Steeper learning curve for web developers.
- Heavier and more complex to set up compared to Electron.
